# Sign arithmetic — which way a quantity is going

- **Covers:** the three-valued sign domain, the `signOf` / `trendOf` vocabulary and the
  `derivativeOf` edge between them, the three qualitative arithmetic relations and their
  tables, the one ambiguous entry and the comparison that resolves it, the fixpoint the
  prover runs, and what a derived sign rests on.
- **Not here:** comparing two *measures* against a unit table →
  [quantity.md](quantity.md); how long an interval is →
  [duration.md](duration.md); relation algebras over jointly-exhaustive base relations →
  [qcn.md](qcn.md); what a `SupportingProver` owes a forward join →
  [inference.md](inference.md).
- **Assumes:** context, belief, handle, support, prover, forward join →
  [glossary.md](glossary.md).

Nobody knows how fast the tap runs or how fast the drain empties, and everybody knows the
tub fills when the tap runs faster than the drain. `vaelii.impl.sign` draws that
inference. A quantity's **sign** is one of `SignNegative`, `SignZero`, `SignPositive`,
and three declared relations say which quantities add, subtract and multiply into which.
The layer holds no numbers.

## The vocabulary

```clojure
(signOf   Tap      SignPositive)      ; the tap adds water
(signOf   Drain    SignNegative)      ; the drain takes it away
(qualitativeSum Tap Drain NetFlow)    ; the net flow is their sum
(derivativeOf   NetFlow WaterLevel)   ; and the net flow is how fast the level moves

(greaterInMagnitudeThan Tap Drain)    ; the tap runs faster than the drain

(v/ask? kb '(signOf  NetFlow    SignPositive) ctx)   ;=> true
(v/ask? kb '(trendOf WaterLevel SignPositive) ctx)   ;=> true — the tub fills
```

The seven predicates live in `resources/kb/upper/measure.txt`, beside the measures:

| | |
|---|---|
| `(signOf Q S)` | Q is negative, zero or positive |
| `(trendOf Q S)` | Q is falling, steady or rising — the sign of its rate of change |
| `(derivativeOf R Q)` | R is the rate at which Q changes |
| `(qualitativeSum A B Q)` | Q is A + B |
| `(qualitativeDifference A B Q)` | Q is A − B |
| `(qualitativeProduct A B Q)` | Q is A × B |
| `(greaterInMagnitudeThan A B)` | A is further from zero than B |

The arithmetic relations say which quantities stand in the relation; no fact states what
any of them amounts to. Every position that holds Q, R, A or B is declared `quantity`, so
`(signOf Tap SignPositive)` derives `(quantity Tap)`.

The three sign values are individuals of the type `sign_value`, **jointly exhaustive and
pairwise disjoint** over the reals, the property a relation algebra's base relations have
([qcn.md](qcn.md)). So a set of them is a constraint, and excluding a value proves the
negation.

## The tables

**Addition.** Zero is the identity, like signs keep theirs, and opposite signs take the
sign of the larger addend:

| + | − | 0 | + |
|---|---|---|---|
| **−** | − | − | ? |
| **0** | − | 0 | + |
| **+** | ? | + | + |

At `?` **all three values survive**, and a goal about the sum is answered with nothing.
A stated `(greaterInMagnitudeThan A B)` resolves it: the sum takes A's sign, and is not
zero, since the order is strict. The comparison is between two quantities with no figure;
`quantityGreaterThan` compares two ground `(QuantityFn …)` terms ([quantity.md](quantity.md)).

**Subtraction** is addition with the subtrahend negated, so two quantities of the *same*
sign make the ambiguous difference, and the same comparison of the two quantities
resolves it.

**Multiplication** is never ambiguous: anything times zero is zero, like signs give a
positive and opposite signs a negative.

## Trends are signs, one edge along

`(derivativeOf R Q)` says R is the rate at which Q changes, and `(trendOf Q S)` is R's
sign read at Q. One arithmetic and one fixpoint serve both, and the edge constrains
**both ways**:

- *down* — a rate with a known sign makes its quantity rising, falling or steady.
- *up* — a stated trend pins the rate, which can then be an addend elsewhere, and two
  rates declared of one quantity take the same sign.

A rate is an ordinary quantity, so **the rate of a sum is stated as a sum of the rates**.
No rule infers rate arithmetic from quantity arithmetic: `d(A+B) = dA + dB` holds, and
`d(A×B)` is not a function of `dA` and `dB`. `trendOf` is stated directly where the rate
has no name.

## The fixpoint

The reading is a **greatest fixpoint** over sets of possible signs, computed as a
path-consistency pass is (`resolve-state` documents the state and constraint maps). Each
arithmetic relation is one constraint and each `derivativeOf` edge two; a stated sign
narrows its quantity to one value, and two stated signs that disagree narrow it to
nothing. Every step shrinks a set in a three-element lattice over finitely many keys, so
the pass terminates, and intersection is commutative and associative, so the fixpoint
does not depend on constraint order. The pass re-applies a constraint only after one of
its inputs moved, and a narrowed quantity's support shares the supports it was derived
from rather than copying them, so a chain of n links costs n narrowings and a rebuild of
the reading is linear in the sign facts (`lein perf`'s `sign-chain-rebuild`).

**A set narrowed to nothing is a contradiction.** The reading is then `:inconsistent`, a
`:sign-inconsistency` entry naming the emptied quantities goes to `(violations kb)`, and
**no** sign goal in that context is answered, a stated one included. It is a report and
not a `wff` refusal, [as for a qualitative
network](defenses.md#an-impossible-network-is-reported-off-the-pass-not-thrown-as-a-wff-check).

`signOf` is **not** declared `functional`, though a quantity has one sign. `functional`
merges two symbol arguments through the equality partition ([equality.md](equality.md)),
so a KB that said both positive and negative would have `SignPositive` and
`SignNegative` made one term instead of the contradiction reported.

## What a derived sign rests on

`SignProver` implements `prover-types/SupportingProver`, so each answer carries the
handles behind it, and the JTMS withdraws a forward firing on a derived sign when one of
them goes.

A narrowing's support is the union of its inputs' supports, the relation's handle and,
where a stored comparison decided the result, the comparison's handle, added **only when the
set moved**. A comparison decides only a sum whose addends can have opposite signs, so a
product, or a sum of like signs, does not rest on one. It
over-approximates one derivation on the two counts [qcn.md](qcn.md#support-what-an-entailed-relation-rests-on)
states. The constraints run in an order fixed by their **content** (relation, arguments,
edge direction), so which witness a narrowing names does not depend on arrival order
([nmtms.md](nmtms.md)).

`support-sources` names all seven predicates, so a `greaterInMagnitudeThan` arriving
*after* the rule and the facts re-joins the rules carrying a sign antecedent
([inference.md](inference.md), "What a computed answer rests on").

## Reading out

A goal `(signOf Q S)` is answered by **entailment**: the possible set must be exactly
`S`. An open `S` binds when the set is a singleton; an open `Q` enumerates the quantities
the reading records, in content order. `(not (signOf Q S))` is answered by
**refutation**: the possible set excludes `S`. An open `S` under a negation is not
answered.

A quantity the reading never reached is answered with nothing under either polarity:
the engine knows no sign for it and can rule none out.

`cost` is `:compute` and `completeness` is 100. The reading is **resident** on the KB,
stamped with the change clock as a qualitative network is ([qcn.md](qcn.md), "The
network is resident, and the clock is what makes that sound"), so a rule joining a sign
antecedent over many bindings computes it once.

## Opt-in

```clojure
(v/add-reasoner kb :sign)
```

The prover is opt-in and the vocabulary is not. Until the prover is registered a KB
stores and retrieves `signOf` and the rest as ordinary facts and composes none of them.
`QuantityProver` sits in `default-provers` because it computes from the two ground
measures in the goal at `:lookup` cost; a sign is read off a network of stored facts, and
registering the prover changes what a KB derives.

## What is not here

- **No magnitudes.** A KB with figures compares them with [quantity.md](quantity.md)'s
  measures. The two layers do not meet: a measure is not read into a sign, and a sign is
  not read out as a measure.
- **No reverse arithmetic.** A sum's sign is derived from its addends' and never the other
  way about, though the total and one addend bound the other. The `derivativeOf` edge is
  the one constraint that runs both ways.
- **No chained comparison.** `greaterInMagnitudeThan` is declared `transitive`, and the
  reading consults only the stored comparisons: `A > B` and `B > C` leave a sum of `A`
  and `C` ambiguous although `(greaterInMagnitudeThan A C)` is answered true.
- **No division.** The sign of a quotient is the sign of a product, and a KB states the
  product the other way round.
- **No time.** A trend is the sign of a rate and says nothing about *when*. What holds at
  a moment is the event calculus in [time.md](time.md), and the two are not connected.

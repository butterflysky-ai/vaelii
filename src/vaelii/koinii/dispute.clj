  "Koinii dispute reads: two context-scoped views over the engine's
  whole-KB contradiction surface, plus the small dispute-STATE surface the
  adjudication driver drives.

  The engine *represents* contradiction but answers it only whole-KB: `contradictions`
  and `conflicts` each scan the whole store and hand back entries whose sides carry
  their own `:context`.  A subscriber wants the per-channel question — 'is there an open
  dispute *here*?' — so that scoping lives in one wrapper rather than being re-derived at
  every call site.

  **'Disputed' is a precise word.**  It is NOT 'false' and NOT 'defeated-by-strength'.
  A dispute is a *coexisting* clash — S and ¬S both believed with no strength winner, so
  `argue` returns `:contradiction` and the engine deliberately leaves both standing
  (paraconsistent tolerance — Priest's LP, the four-valued `argue`).  A clean
  strength-defeat (a `:monotonic` premise beating a `:default` one) is the opposite: the
  loser is `:defeated`, `argue` returns `:false`, and that is *resolved*, not disputed.

  Two error classes, kept distinct, never merged:

  - **`:contradiction`** — a coexisting `:default` dilemma (a rebuttal, or a definitional
    clash left at equal strength).  Both sides believed; `argue` -> `:contradiction`.
  - **`:conflict`** — an irreducible clash among `:monotonic` content: two things asserted
    known-true that cannot both hold, which the engine has no grounds to prefer.  Harder
    than a rebuttal, and a caller usually wants to see it alongside.

  **Detection matches the engine, not the intuition.**  A coexisting dilemma keeps BOTH
  sides `in?`, so `why-not` reports `:believed? true` on either — it never reads
  `:defeated` there (that reason is reserved for the strength-defeat, i.e. the resolved
  case).  So the named-sentence read is `argue`, whose `:contradiction` verdict is exactly
  'both provable, neither strength-wins' and whose context scoping is exactly 'the asker
  sees both sides'.  `argue` is per-sentence and never computes whole-KB contradictions,
  which is the perf property the hot path needs.

  This module owns the *reads*, the state *vocabulary*, and the dispute *id*.  The clock,
  the timeout value, and the notify sink are the driver's.  So the
  recording functions here take the timestamp (and stale reason) from the caller rather
  than reading a clock: this module supplies the mechanism, the driver supplies the policy.

  Additive, like the sibling koinii modules: only the public core API (`argue`,
  `canonical-sentex`, `sentex-handle`) — nothing under `vaelii.impl`, and nothing in core
  loads it."

;; ---- the dispute id: a stable name for one clash -------------------------

(defn dispute-id
  "The stable id of a dispute `entry` (from `disputes-in`, `contradictions`, or
  `conflicts`): its side `:handle`s, sorted.  Order-independent, so the same clash always
  yields the same id however the engine happened to order the sides — the key the driver
  attaches lifecycle state to.

  Two handles for a rebuttal and three for an `anti_transitive` chain: a nogood is a *set*
  and the engine reports it whole (docs/nmtms.md), so this reads `:handles` rather than
  destructuring it as a pair."
  [entry]
  (vec (sort (:handles entry))))

(defn dispute-key
  "`id` in the ONE spelling every reader compares — the sorted handle pair `dispute-id`
  builds.  The single home for that sort, and the reason there is one: a caller may hold
  the pair either way round (`dispute-id` sorts, but its contract accepts any two-handle
  seq and `disputes-in` hands the entries out), and a mark or a provenance tag written
  under `[479 478]` is invisible to a read for `[478 479]` — a standing ruling no guard
  can see.  A non-sequential id passes through unchanged."
  [id]
  (if (sequential? id) (vec (sort id)) id))

(defn dispute-term
  "The reified term naming a dispute by its id, for the stored lifecycle marks:
  `(dispute (sentexHandle h) …)`, handles sorted (`dispute-key`) so the term is a function
  of the clash and not of argument order.  `id` is a `dispute-id` or any handle seq.

  **As many handles as the clash has**, never the first two.  A nogood is a *set* and
  `anti_transitive` forms one over three sentexes (docs/nmtms.md), so `disputes-in` hands
  back three-handle entries — and a term keyed on a pair would name two different
  three-member disputes identically whenever they shared their two lowest handles, and
  name a three-member one the same as the pair over those two.  The marks this term keys
  are the notify and stale sweeps' idempotency key, so a collision is a dispute silently
  never announced."

;; ---- disputes-in: the whole surface, scoped to what a context sees -------

(defn- observed-by?
  "Does `ctx` observe the clash `entry` — i.e. can it read BOTH clashing sides?  A
  contradiction is visible exactly where both its sentences are readable, up the
  `genlCx` ancestor set (`sees?`).  So a clash between `(ist CxAtlas P)` and `(ist CxBoreas ¬P)`
  surfaces in the channel `CxDeploy` (which sees both agent contexts) and NOT in a
  sibling that sees only one — from a one-sided vantage there is no clash to see, and
  `argue` from there returns `:true`, not `:contradiction`.  Both-sides is what keeps the
  named read (`disputed?`, `argue`-based) and this whole-surface read agreeing."

(defn disputes-in

  (`:contradiction` — a coexisting `:default` dilemma / `:conflict` — a `:monotonic`
  irreducible clash) and its stable `:dispute-id`.  The engine entry's own `:kind`
  (`:disjoint` / `:functional` / `:asymmetric` / `:anti-transitive`, nil for a plain
  rebuttal) rides along unchanged.

  This is the per-channel view the whole-KB `contradictions` cannot give: 'what is
  disputed *here*'.  It hides nothing and invents nothing — the union of `disputes-in`
  over every context equals `(contradictions kb)` + `(conflicts kb)`, because the
  common-descendant context that raised each clash sees both of its sides and so reports
  it.  Conflicts are folded in by default (most callers want the harder monotonic clashes
  beside the rebuttals); a caller wanting only one class filters on `:dispute-class`."

  "The load + scale benchmark against the **in-memory backend**
  (`vaelii.impl.memory`): Zipfian synthetic facts through the real
  `kb/create-sentex` load path, then the query shapes measured at the protocol
  level.  Two metrics:

  - **Latency.**  A RAM index issues no round trips, so the number to watch is
    wall-clock.  The headline is the **leading-variable fan**
    (`(hotPred ?x hotInd)` — the after-a-variable trie fan), which walks a node per
    fanned value; the argument-root path answers the same shape in one lookup and
    sits beside it for comparison.

  - **RAM, measured as JVM heap.**  Split into index and records: load, measure
    retained heap, `clear-index!`, measure again — the difference is the index's
    footprint, the remainder the records'.


  Run: `lein bench-memory [facts] [rules] [iters]`  (defaults 200000 20000 200).
  Uses space 10 in the in-memory registry — no server, no
  external dependency."

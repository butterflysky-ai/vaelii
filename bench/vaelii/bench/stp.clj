  "Metric-temporal closure scaling — what a `temporalDistance` answer costs, and what an
  *arriving* constraint costs the answer after it.

  The closure is all-pairs shortest paths over the distance graph a network describes, so
  one pass is cubic in the **instant** count.  It is memoized on the network value, which
  makes a query loop over one belief state free after the first ask — and makes an arriving
  constraint a different network, so the pass would run again.  Loading a KB one fact at a
  time is therefore a cubic pass per fact unless the pass is warm-started, and this harness
  is what says how much that is worth at the sizes a KB reaches.

  Seven readings per instant count, and they answer different questions:

    - **scratch** — one `stp/close` over the whole network, from nothing.  The cost of the
      first answer in a context, and the floor a cold pass cannot get under.
    - **add → close** / **add → warm** — the pure-data loop, both routes: narrow one more
      constraint between instants already there, then either close the whole network again
      or relax the constraint into the state the last close reached.  No KB, no belief, no
      measures — the algorithm alone.  The constraint spans a long stretch of the chain and
      is far tighter than the chain implies, so most of the network moves: this is the
      **dense** case for the warm start, where what it saves is the pass and not the
      read-back.
    - **grow → close** / **grow → warm** — the same pair where each arriving constraint
      names an instant the network has never held, which is what loading a timeline does.
      Only that instant's own bounds are new, so the read-back is linear and the warm start
      shows what it is worth when the answer moves as much as an arriving fact usually
      moves it.
    - **KB read** — `stp/problem` alone: the believed-fact read and the magnitude
      normalization behind every answer, with no closure at all.  What the per-add readings
      below carry that the pure ones do not.
    - **add → query (KB)** — the dense add through the engine: assert one more
      `temporalDistance` fact, then ask for the closed network.
    - **memo hit (KB)** — the same ask with *nothing* changed.  The network is resident on
      the KB and the closure is keyed on its value, so this is what a query loop pays per
      question once the first one is answered.

  The last two are the pair a decision about warm-starting turns on: an add that costs many
  times a memo hit is a recompute, and one that costs a memo hit is not.

  Every network here is a **chain** — instant `i` some distance after instant `i-1` — which
  is the form a sequence of events produces and the dense case for the read-back: a chain
  pins a bound between every pair, so the closed network holds n² of them however few were
  written.  Magnitudes are integers and every generated constraint contains the true gap of
  a fixed assignment, so nothing measured here is the inconsistency path.

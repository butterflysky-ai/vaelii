  "Definitional collection relations: `defnNecessary` / `defnSufficient` / `defnIff`
  tie a collection's membership to a condition on the member `?x`, and expand into
  ordinary forward rules at assert.

  What the tests hold to is that the expansion is *into the existing machinery* — the
  conclusion is a materialized, justified sentex, not a prover's ephemeral answer — so
  it retracts, belief-follows, recovers and scopes to a context exactly as any derived
  fact does.  And that the reading is **open-world**: nothing closes the collection's
  complement, so a thing the condition is merely silent about is neither a member nor a
  non-member.  See docs/defns.md."

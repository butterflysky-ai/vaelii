  "`exceptWhen`: a rule that states its own exception.  Every test here holds against
  the shipped feature — the evaluator is `provers/exception-holds?`, the fixpoint that
  re-runs it is `vaelii.impl.settle`, and the stratification the loop relies on is
  checked at assert time by `checks/check-stratified`.

  Each test pins one decision from [docs/exceptions.md](../../docs/exceptions.md)
  and carries a comment naming it.  The shape under test is

    (exceptWhen <query> (set/defaultRule (implies <antecedents> <consequent>)))

  and the four claims that shape makes are: the exception **blocks** rather than
  deriving a competing negation; it is any closed **level-6** query (no rule
  backchaining); **one answer suffices**; and **nothing about it is stored**.

  House rules apply as everywhere else: gensym'd temporaries via `tu/with-terms`,
  engine vocabulary (`genl`, `set/defaultRule`, `exceptWhen`, `transitive`,
  contexts) literal, and the neutral fixture asserts the KB is restored."

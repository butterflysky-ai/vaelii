  "The `genlCx` move oracle: a KB built by a random order of writes and retractions holds
  what a fresh KB loaded with the final premises in content order holds
  (docs/contexts.md, \"One context move\").  A world is a context DAG under CxUniverse,
  memberships, forward rules (one may conclude a `genlCx` edge), `genlCx` edges, an
  except of an edge, an except of a fact stated in another context, and an except of an
  except.  The judge compares, per context of the world: `ask?` over every membership of
  the world's types and individuals, the stored sentences, and each stored sentex's
  justification antecedents the network does not hold blocked, every handle read by
  content.  A blocked justification and a firing refused at its placement read alike.  The `genlCx` edges a firing names as its witness path are left out of its
  antecedents: a firing names one path, the first it found (docs/nmtms.md), so two
  orders can name two paths that both stand.  A stored firing the
  KB keeps below a placement the other KB holds is history (docs/nmtms.md, \"Where the
  layer stops\"), in either KB, and is not a disagreement.  A red world is shrunk to the
  fewest operations that keep it red."

  `add-reasoner :brave-cautious`): a read-path brave/cautious classification of the current

  optima; the solve-free tests force the no-backend path (`with-redefs` on
  `solver/available?`) so they read the JTMS bracket (`label/classify-local`) and run
  everywhere, and the not-assertible refusal is backend-independent too."

  ;; The fixtures are dilemmas whose members derive from none of the other members.

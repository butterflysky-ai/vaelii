  "The taxonomy caches must agree with the KB about what it entails.

  The cached genl / genlCx closures are derived state — the source of truth is the
  set of *believed* sentexes asserting each edge. Four ways that agreement can
  break, each covered here: defeat leaving a stale edge, a derived edge never
  arriving, `recover` disagreeing with the running KB, and a shared edge dying with
  the first of its several asserting sentexes.

  The four flat caches — `disjoint`, disjoint metatypes + members, the predicate
  properties, and `inverse` — follow the network the same way: `refresh-beliefs`
  reconciles each `:cache-support` entry after every relabel, and a scoped read filters
  each supporter through the read walk. So a defeated `(transitive P)` stops composing
  and a defeated `(inverse P Q)` stops answering the swapped goal at the contexts that
  see the defeat — each reviving when the defeater is retracted. A `disjoint`, a
  `functional` mark, a `genlCx` edge and an equality are on the engine's baseline
  forced-monotonic roster, so no denial defeats one. The end-to-end half of that is at
  the foot of this file."
